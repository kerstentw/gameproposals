What is Gameproposals.com?

Have you ever had an idea for a game? Of course you have. As gamers, it’s only 

natural to fantasize about some of things you would like to see in your favourite 

titles. Maybe you’ve even had an idea for something entirely new. Unless you 

work in game development however, that’s typically where the idea stops. 

Gameproposals.com is here to change that. 

As an open, community-driven forum, this website has been specifically set up to 

serve as a hub for all the great game concepts out there that have never gotten 

their chance to shine. All that’s required for you to get involved is a love of the 

form and an idea.

You might have a piece of art. A story outline or a script. Gameplay mechanics. 

Music. Or, it could be all of the above, combined into one meaty, fully realised 

proposal. Once uploaded, other users can read, rate and comment on your ideas, 

perhaps even incorporating some of them into their own work. Yeah. You read 

that right. People will steal your shit. And that’s exactly the point. Everything 

posted here is fair game, to be freely used and appropriated by the community at 

large. 

This isn’t about personal glory or financial gain. It’s about sharing ideas.

How it all works.

The website itself is split into three distinct sections. 

The Pit. An oozing, bubbling chasm of potential. If you have an idea for a brand 

new title, this is where you bring it. Proposals here are limited to a two hundred-
word brief. At the end of each week, the five highest rated will be exhumed from 

the depths and given their own board in the New Games section. Here work can 

begin on more detailed, complete proposals. 

The third is Existing Series. As the name implies, this is dedicated to video game 

series already in existence. Proposals here are not intended to cover previously 

released games, but rather what you would like to see in future iterations of the 

series. Have the perfect idea for a new Halo multiplayer mode? Know how to get 

the Sonic franchise back on its feet? This place is for you.
